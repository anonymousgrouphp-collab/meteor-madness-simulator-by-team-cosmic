Meteor Madness Simulator
An interactive web application developed for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge. This tool allows users to simulate near-Earth asteroid impact scenarios, analyze potential consequences, and explore mitigation strategies through a dynamic, data-driven interface.

üöÄ Key Features
Dual Modes: Switch between a creative "Sandbox Mode" for free exploration and a goal-oriented "Challenge Mode" for a specific mission.
Live NASA Data: Load real-time data for upcoming asteroid approaches directly from NASA's Near-Earth Object API.
Interactive Global Map: Visually select an impact point on a 2D world map to understand localized consequences.
Automatic Impact Briefing: Instantly generate a detailed, data-driven report analyzing the consequences of the simulated impact.
Educational Mitigation Briefings: Learn how real-world planetary defense systems like Kinetic Impactors, Gravity Tractors, and Laser Ablation work with on-demand information panels.
Shareable Results: Create and share a concise "Impact Report Card" to communicate simulation outcomes.
Immersive Audio: Sound effects for UI interactions, successful mitigations, and impacts provide a more engaging experience.

üåü Project Purpose & Vision
The "Meteor Madness" project was designed to solve a key part of the NASA challenge: making complex astronomical data accessible and engaging for everyone. By transforming raw data points about asteroid size and velocity into an interactive story with instant analysis and educational content, we hope to raise public awareness about the real-world challenges and solutions in planetary defense. This tool serves not just as a simulator, but as an educational platform to foster curiosity and understanding.
