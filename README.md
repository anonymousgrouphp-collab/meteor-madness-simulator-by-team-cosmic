# Meteor Madness Simulator

An interactive web application developed for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge. This tool allows users to simulate near-Earth asteroid impact scenarios, analyze potential consequences, and explore mitigation strategies through a dynamic, data-driven interface.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Accurate Geopolitical Impact Modeling:** An interactive world map allows users to select a target country. The simulator then uses a GeoJSON-based data model to calculate a **Socio-Economic Impact score** based on the specific country's demographic and development profile.
* **Live NASA Data:** Load real-time data for upcoming asteroid close approaches directly from NASA's Near-Earth Object API to simulate real-world scenarios.
* **Automatic Impact Briefing:** Instantly generate a detailed, data-driven report analyzing the physical and environmental consequences of the simulated impact.
* **Educational Mitigation Briefings:** Learn how real-world planetary defense systems like Kinetic Impactors and Gravity Tractors work with on-demand information panels.
* **Shareable Results:** Create and share a concise "Impact Report Card" to communicate simulation outcomes.
* **Immersive Audio:** Sound effects for UI interactions, successful mitigations, and impacts provide a more engaging experience.

## üåü Project Purpose & Vision

The "Meteor Madness" project was designed to solve a key part of the NASA challenge: making complex astronomical data accessible and engaging for everyone. By transforming raw data points into an interactive story with instant, geographically-aware analysis and educational content, we hope to raise public awareness about the real-world challenges and solutions in planetary defense.
